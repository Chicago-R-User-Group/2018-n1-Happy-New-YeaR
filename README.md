# 2018-n1-Happy-New-YeaR

The Chicago R User's Group returns January 27 with Charlotte Frei and Joe Cursio organizing our second Saturday workshop at IIT Stuart School, Room 270.

We have two great talks lined up, with discussion time and working time built-in:

## 11:00-11:30 am: Back to Basics with Base R

Should an old acquaintance be forgotten? No! Parfait Gasana (https://stackoverflow.com/users/1422451/parfait) will demonstrate the pros and cons of base R, including applications of the apply family, and draw comparisons to dplyr and data.table.

See Jupyter Notebooks including R scripts and Meetup API and Census data:

- Apply Family Demo
- Benchmark Demo

## 12:00-12:30 pm: IDBac: A Shiny App to Analyze Bacterial Fingerprints and Aid in the Discovery of Potential New Antibiotics

Then, good tidyings we bring: Chase Clark (https://chasemc.github.io/IDBac/) will demo a Shiny application intended to make spectroscopy analyses more accessible and highlight the usability features.

## 1:00-2:00 pm - 
Stick around for Q&A, to refactor your code, or to build a Shiny app.
